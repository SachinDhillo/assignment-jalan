  <H3>Assignment : Jalan Technologies</h3>

  <h4><em>Task 1.</em> Please go through the mentioned blog and suggest improvisation â€“ Title, Image or Content
    to better tailor to higher engagement.
    Blog Link - <a href="https://www.blog.jalantechnologies.com/post/micropayments-how-it-schanging-
online-payments">jalan blogs</a></h4>

  <strong>1. I did a research on this blog, found a suitable keyword for this blog - "Online Payment" - This keyword has <u>14800 search/month</u> and a <u>cpc of 0.24.</u>
    Hence to make this blog seo friendly and and more engaging following are my suggestions - </strong>

  <ol>
    <li>Add Focus keyword in most of heading tags <u>(mainly in H1, H2, H3) </u><br>
      Why: It will help seach engines in <u>crawling and rendering </u>the content of the page, hence increase probability of rankings.</li>

    <li> There should be <u>images</u> in blog, that will boost user experience and also help in SEO process. <br>
      Why: In case when search engines for some reason unable to read the content in source, images can help them to understand the content( by including <u>alt tag in them</u>) and adding a <u>title</u> to the images (mentioning focus keyword in
      it). </li>

    <li>Content should be in <u>Subheading and sub content</u> form (though there are some, but still it requires a bit change). <br>
      Why: It simplfies our blog and help users to find it more problem solving rather than another word cloud.</li>

    <li> Heading and subheading should be highlighted in some another colour.<br>
      Why: Increase the user experience, make blog much catchy. </li>

    <li> There are no internal links in the blog. <br>
      Why: There should be <u> internal and external links</u> in blogs. ( <u>from seo's perspective it increases you SEO score and page authority.</u> )</li>
  </ol>

  <strong>Another Tips- </strong>
  <ul>
    <li>There should be a <u>table of content attached with the title</u> or in before the body of article<br>
      Why: It will help users found you blogs content easy and feasible (suppose if some one want to know about a particular section, they can jump right to the that section). </li>

    <li>There should be a <u>comment section</u>with every blog. <br>
      Why: You can know about what your audience speaks about your content. </li>

    <li>There should be a <u>Email Subscription tab with blogs</u> <br>
      Why: It will increase you user base, you can use that email for email marketing, can send timely notifications about new product, blog etc. </li>

    <li>There must be a <u>sidebar</u> that shows recent posts, latest posts or some new offers. </li>
  </ul>

  <h4><em>Task2.</em> Please suggest five immediate improvements or changes we should make for better visitors
    engagement on our website and convert them to leads?
    Our website -<a href=" https://www.jalantechnologies.com">Jalan Technologies</a></h4>

  <strong> Following are the suggestions I want to you to have on your website</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>I found no <u>menu or navigation bar</u> in your website, it is one of the important part of a website, <br>
      which helps a user to interact with your website</li>
    <li>There should be <u>top bar</u> where you can show quick connection buttons like <strong>"call", "location","Mail" </strong> etc.<br>
      this also helps in <em>generating organic leads</em></li>
    <li> There should be a <u>slider or catchy image</u> in header body part of the website<br>
      that explains about your business</li>
    <li><u>Service section</u> should be designed properly and must have icons or images<br>
      that helps user to quickly understand about what we are offering</li>
    <li>there must be a <em> testimonial</em> section <br>
      this increase the brand credebility as well as user trust in your product</li>
    <li>There should be a <u>contact us</u> tab that include<br>
      <em>a form</em> which user can fill and send us(generating a lead for your product) or a <em>button</em> clicking on which user gets redirected to our contact us page. </li>
    <li>There should a properly designed footer there which shows atleast:</li>

    <ol>
      <li>html sitemap</li>
      <li>quick links like call, mail etc</li>
      <li>Locations</li>
      <li>Privacy,copyright links etc</li>
